_Monday, March 26th, 2018_ â€¢ Floyd Bennett Field & SMNT, Brooklyn, NY 

Kestrel hopping from Floyd Bennett Field to Salt Marsh Nature Trail. 

Saw that Kenny at Salt Marsh has a girlfriend now (saw them perform coitus _four_ times). It wasn't an incredibly hot day but the sun was shining down hard, creating heat shimmer low to the ground.
