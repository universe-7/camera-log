Hi it's Pete. What's here are notes I make while editing pictures. I take these notes to remember what I was interested when I shot the pictures. Also included are weather conditions and general statistics (e.g. _number of photos shot_) per day out. 

All of this is pretty freeform or _stream of consciousness_, so I wouldn't expect things to make a ton of sense. One day I might form these notes into more communicable thoughts.

## Processes

How I go about taking and editing pictures: it's a gradual process that is subject to tinkering. Previously much of my work was done in studio, a controlled environment where it was easy to be organized. When I started photographing birds (around July 2017), organization was no longer so simple. 

#### capture one - bridge - photoshop

At this point I'm going out with three 32 gb and two 16 gb CF cards (and a backup 32 gb SD card). After shooting for the day, I'll import all the photos into a daily session in Capture One Pro. From there it's a process of tagging the images 1-5 stars, with the higher stars being processed first. 

After this, I'll edit these photos down in Bridge to get to what I want to edit in Photoshop.

Once edited in Photoshop, some images eventually become postable jpegs.

#### contact sheets

Previously, I'd processed a wide range of selects as small jpegs and printed contact sheets. I'd mark these up then go back into the session to process selects hi res. That's not to say I wouldn't do this again - different sessions seem to require different solutions. 


#### sites

This blog of raw notes is yet another part of the process. Because I shoot a lot, and go out shooting often, a lot of images don't get the time they might deserve. So I think of this log as a way to not only remember what I was thinking, but also to scan in the future when I need to pull, say, a _yellow-rumped warbler_ from the archive.

Before having a Markdown doc open to take notes while editing, I'd have a physical notebook and pens in front of me to record shots and thoughts.
