## üìÅ

A lone yellowlegs was in that little innermost northeast pocket of the bay. Greater or lesser? It occurred to me that it was a _Greater Yellowlegs_ based on it's size. I love how _pronounced_ their movements are. Never noticed how cool their plumage was either. This guy was gone fishin'. He even caught a little striper, a delight for me as well as him I'm sure. Maybe he caught 2 - I didn't get a shot of the first one being swallowed.

Pushing along the water, water like a mirror, creating waves of energy all around him.



## üìÅüìÅ

There were a lot more sharp-shinned hawk photos than I remember, also a crow flock. The dives I was unsatisfied with actually look kinda nice, painterly. What I thought was a territory dispute was actually a sharp-shinned hawk chasing the kestrels across the field. After the hawk flew off, there was an aerial display (presumably courtship) with the two kestrels that I was too excited to photograph clearly. 

First up close look at the lady - catalog of head shots of the female kestrel through the branches.

## üìÅüìÅüìÅ

Cataloguing different head gestures with the lady again. I keep thinking Kenny's looking thinner these days, but the lady looks well-fed.

She makes me think of the final fight in _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ because of the way she balances on the most delicate branches in the wind.

The male disappeared after a dive for a whle after the 4th copulation - I wondered if he caught something and went to cache it? Looks like it (1885) - holy shit thats a huge mouse/rat/vole.

## üìÅüìÅüìÅüìÅ

The grass looks great on an overcast day. I've got to remember that overcast is the best lighting, second only maybe to blizzard.

- 0886: if i spoke kestrel, he's probably tellin me to chill out
- **it was the sharp-shinned chasing** i knew i saw three
- sharp-shinned sure looks a lot like lady kestrel. and his shins definitely are sharp? reminds me of that potential young cooper?

	- vocal
	- male initiated (he flew in)
- glide sample 01: ~4 second duration, > 1 second on ground before taking wing (1149-1157)
- long slow glides first observed in female, but then observed in male also. contrast with 01/21/2018, where there were short 'dive-bombs' from perch nearly directly downward.

	- 11:45:00 AM (1673) - visibly dismounted

	- potentially unsuccessful? awkward branch angle
	- same tree from territorial dispute (01/21/2018)
- (1885) rat to cache - 11:57:11 AM - gotta check the frames for details sometimes before turning to another subject. Kenny flew off and I wondered if he was gonna cache something....yes he was. Or go eat it on his own.
