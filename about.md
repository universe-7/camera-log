Hi it's Pete. What's here are notes I make while editing pictures. I take these notes to remember what I was interested when I shot the pictures. Also included are weather conditions and general statistics (e.g. _number of photos shot_) per day out. 

All of this is pretty freeform or _stream of consciousness_, so I wouldn't expect things to make a ton of sense. One day I might form these notes into more communicable thoughts.
