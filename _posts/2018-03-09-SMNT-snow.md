_Friday, March 9th, 2018_ • Salt Marsh Nature Trail, Brooklyn, NY

I was disappointed Kes/Kenny didn't show up; maybe I was just there too early. It was really quiet and I resorted to distractedly photographing clouds and wondering about Floyd Bennett Field. Out of nowhere I hear the wings - something hovering, distinct from the gulls. Wingbeats so fast, yet staying in one place in the air. The Kingfisher! _Mythical bastard_. I'd seen so many incidentally when I was greener that the hype around it never seemed to faze me. Well - now it did. 

I understood why the West Indian guy was so urgent asking me if I saw _it_ when we crossed paths in Prospect Park two days earlier. I had to ask what _it_ was...he was still nice to me even as I told him I was following the two Coots that were swimming under the bridge.

It made sense why that lady at the East Pond (Jamaica Bay) had such _detailed information_ when a Kingfisher was hanging near the (occupied) blinds last October. She zoomed into some pictures and showed me an amazing shot she got of him diving for a fish. 

When Phong told me he was going to Vietnam for a month, I asked him if it was to see family. He said _yea_ somewhat half-heartedly, before telling me _there's a Kingfisher I really want to get a photograph of_.
